# CalculatorC
This is a calculator I have made in C.  I made it when I was bored, and I am updating it every once in a while to be able to calculate different things.
I made it during quarantine in November 2020, back when I started doing computer science in school again, and I found it interesting again.  I decided to try and code to practice, and making a calculator instantly came to mind.
There were many different ways I could have done things, especially in C I could have made it in any way but I chose a very simple and good looking way which can easily be read.
I commented as much as I could to clear up any mishap and misunderstanding in the code.
I have been working on it since November, fine tuning many things, and re-adjusting code.  I also introduced new operations and calculations one could use, in order to maximize this calculator's abilities.  Even though it is slow, and a regular calculator is better, I think if I can start introducing formulas and other types of things to do in it it could be useful one day.  Some formulas are already included such as pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), which I added at a later date.
In all, it is a work-in-progress and none of it is final, and there will not be any final as I will keep updating it as long as I have the time and the patience to do so.
